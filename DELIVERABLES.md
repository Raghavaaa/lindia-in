---

### Workflow 2: `pre-migration-snapshot.yml`
**Purpose:** Create Railway database snapshot before running migrations

- `migration_description`: Brief description (required)
- `service_name`: database or backend (required)

---

### Workflow 3: `safe-deploy.yml`
**Purpose:** Deploy to Railway with manual approval gate and rollout policy  
**Location:** `.github/workflows/safe-deploy.yml`  
**Triggers:** Manual workflow_dispatch or tag push (v*.*.*, stable-*)  
**Key Features:**
- **Manual approval gate** for production
- Pre-deployment validation checks
- Progressive rollout strategy:
  - Stage 1: Canary deployment (10% traffic)
  - Stage 2: Health check wait (30s)
  - Stage 3: Full deployment (100% traffic)
- Post-deployment verification
- Failure notification with recovery steps

**Required Secrets:**
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (from repository secrets)

**Approval Gates:**
1. Pre-deployment checks must pass
2. Manual approval required for production environment
3. Post-deployment health verification

**Workflow Inputs:**
- `environment`: staging or production (required)
- `deployment_type`: standard, hotfix, or rollback (required)

---

## 📋 Deliverable 3: Snapshot & Rollback Runbook

**Status:** ✅ **Documented in README.md**

**Location:** `README.md` - Section: "📸 Snapshot & Rollback Runbook"

### Runbook Steps (One-Line Entries):

**Creating Manual Snapshots (Railway UI):**
1. Navigate Railway Dashboard → Project → Service → Deployments → ⋮ → Create Snapshot
2. Name format: `pre-migration-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description`
3. Verify in Snapshots section

**Creating Snapshots (Railway CLI):**
1. `railway login && railway link`
2. `railway deployment snapshot create --service database --name "pre-migration-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"`
3. `railway deployment snapshot list` to verify

**Restoring from Snapshot (Railway UI):**
1. Railway Dashboard → Project → Service → Snapshots
2. Select snapshot → Verify details → Click Restore
3. **Approval gate:** Confirm restoration
4. Monitor Deployments tab
5. Verify health endpoint and logs

**Restoring from Snapshot (Railway CLI):**
1. `railway deployment snapshot list --service database`
2. `railway deployment snapshot restore <snapshot-id>`
3. `railway logs --follow` to monitor
4. `curl https://service.railway.app/health` to verify

**Approval Gates:**
- Before snapshot: Manual trigger + environment approval + migration description
- Before restore: Manual confirmation + team notification
- After restore: Health check + manual testing + log review

**Emergency Rollback Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify snapshot (timestamp, version)
- [ ] Notify team
- [ ] Create incident ticket
- [ ] Take current state snapshot
- [ ] Execute restore
- [ ] Monitor logs
- [ ] Verify /health endpoint
- [ ] Test critical flows
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Document rollback reason
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem

## 📋 Deliverable 4: Automated Snapshot Policy

**Status:** ✅ **Documented - Not Enabled (As Required)**

**Location:** `README.md` - Section: "Automated Snapshot Policy"

### Snapshot Schedule Recommendation:
- **Daily snapshots:** 02:00 UTC (off-peak hours)
- **Pre-deployment:** Automatic via CI/CD workflow
- **Pre-migration:** Manual trigger required (workflow_dispatch)

### Retention Policy Recommendation:
- **Production snapshots:** 30 days minimum
- **Pre-migration snapshots:** 90 days
- **Manual snapshots:** 60 days
- **Staging snapshots:** 7 days

### Implementation Steps (DO NOT ENABLE YET):
1. Access Railway Dashboard → Project Settings
2. Navigate to Backups/Snapshots section
3. Configure Automated Snapshots
4. Set schedule: Daily at 02:00 UTC
5. Set retention: 30 days for production
6. **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Require manual approval for production
7. Test with staging environment first
8. Monitor first 7 days
9. Verify snapshot integrity weekly
10. Document restoration test procedure

### Storage Considerations:
- Monitor snapshot storage usage monthly
- Archive critical snapshots beyond retention
- Document snapshot purpose in name

## 📋 Additional Deliverables

### env.template Configuration
**Status:** ✅ **Created - No Secrets**

**Location:** `/env.template`

**Contents:**
- Railway configuration placeholders
- GitHub repository reference
- CI environment variables
- Service URLs (placeholders only)
- Monitoring configuration
- **All values use `<placeholder>` format**
- **No hardcoded secrets** ✅

**Verification:**
```bash
# Automated check confirms:
✓ No hardcoded secrets detected
```

---

## 🔒 Security Compliance

**Secrets Management:**
- ✅ No secrets in repository files
- ✅ env.template uses placeholders only
- ✅ Workflows reference GitHub Secrets
- ✅ railway.toml contains no credentials
- ✅ README.md documents secret requirements

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` - For CI/CD deployments
- (Optional) `SENTRY_DSN` - For error monitoring

**Secret Storage Locations:**
- GitHub: Repository Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
- Railway: Dashboard → Project → Variables
- Local: Never committed (.env in .gitignore)

## 🎯 Constraints Compliance

✅ **No DB migrations run from infra tab** - Workflows only create snapshots, no migrations executed  
✅ **No credentials in repo** - All secrets use placeholders or GitHub Secrets  
✅ **Approval gates configured** - Manual approval required for production operations  
✅ **Snapshot policy documented** - Not auto-enabled, requires manual activation  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Not in Scope)

1. Set `RAILWAY_TOKEN` in GitHub repository secrets
2. Configure Railway environments (production/staging)
3. Test workflows in staging environment
4. Enable automated snapshots (after testing)
5. Configure deployment notifications
6. Set up monitoring and alerting
